            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a third-year Computer Science student at the University of the Witwatersrand (Wits). My academic journey has equipped me with a solid foundation in programming, data structures, and software design. I am passionate about developing efficient, well-structured solutions and continuously improving my technical skills through hands-on projects. I am so happy to be doing Software Design as a module this year as I have been looking forward to further my web development skills</p>

            <h2>Latest Project</h2>
            <p>My latest project is an app called "Lend A Hand" which is basically a platform for helping those around you by donating stuff and also get stuff that you need of if someone had donated. It is a really life problem solving projects cause it helps a lot of communities. There's also a few projects heading my way, I should share those once I'm done with them.</p>
