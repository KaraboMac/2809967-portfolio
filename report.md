So far what I have learned about Github and Git as concepts is that Git forms part of Github which is a platform to host your repository and control versions of your projects using Git.
So Git actually does the controlling of versions.
I have also learned that browsers know how to interpret HTML and CSS so we can build websites and webpages to be displayed on the browsers.
